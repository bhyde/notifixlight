h2. Notifixite

h3. What is it?

"Notifixite":http://notifixlite.appspot.com/ is a simple RSS to IM bot.

h3. Usage 

Just add <code>notifixlite@appspot.com</code> to your contact on gtalk (using any "XMPP client":http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/clients/). and get started by saying <code>/help></code>.

h3. TODO

* Google Reader import
* Web interface to consult history
* Add a <code>/track</code> command that directly uses Superfeedr's "track feeds":http://superfeedr.com/documentation#track.
* Allow to get started from the web app, rather than from an XMPP client.
